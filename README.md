# ETL-with-PySpark-and-PostgreSQL
The data that I’ll use is scraped from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen, which is the German branch 
of Ebay where people can advertise their properties. In our case, we will work with a 
dataset that contains information from over 370000 used cars; besides, it’s important 
to note that the content of the data is in German.
